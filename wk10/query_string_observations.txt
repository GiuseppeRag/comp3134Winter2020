Observation 1)
Typing a valid english word in the form caused the website to load a page related to the typed word. The URL of the website also changed, 
as it now contains the word that was typed into the form search bar. This means the website uses GET requests.

Observation 2)
Typing an Invalid English Word into the URL after '/browse' caused to website to load a 'No result found' page. More importantly, the URL also
changed, as instead of 'browse/' as part of the path, it changed to '/misspelling'. This means that the website had automatically redirected
the request to this page using a URL query validator, in order to prevent a possible 404 message.

Observation 3)
Typing the script into the form of the website caused the website to render a page in a slightly unexpected way. Instead of return a 'No
result found' page, it instead replied with 'results for <script>alert(%27hello%27)</script>:', but did not proceed to display any information
related. However, The URL changed again, this time redirecting us to a '/noresult' path, with the script as the term. This means that the
website uses this page to display whenever non-words are inputted into the search form

Observation 4)
Typing the Script into the URL yeilded very similar results to the previous Observation, where the webpage attempted to display results for
the script, but did not display any information afterwards. The URL of the website remained the same as well, leading us to a '/noresult' path
with the script as the search term.
