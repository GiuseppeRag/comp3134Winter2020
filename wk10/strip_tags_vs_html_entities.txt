HTML Entities)
HTML entities do not directly solve the issue of injectings script into the website. HTML entities will allow you to read and display the value
if the value inputted is a proper input. However, if the value inputted is <script> tags, then HTML entities will actually execute them instead
of display values. This is vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into a website

Stripping Tags)
Stripping Tags does solve the issue of script injections by removing any html tags, including <script>, from an input. This method removes
any functionality that the malicious script was meant to do, and the website treats it as a normal input. If combined with HTML tags, the
script is not executed since the <script> tag was stripped, and all the commands are treated as nothing more than strings to be displayed.
