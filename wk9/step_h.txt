In order to prevent comments in the source code, I will do 2 things to the comments:
- The first thing is to turn the comments in PHP comments instead of HTML. This is because HTML comments, while not processed, are
still rendered by the browser. PHP comments however, are ignored entirely by the browser.
- The second thing is to remove any personal information from the comments, since you cannot read data from data that is not there. In my case,
the employee ID will be removed
